This repo is for the final project from UCSD's CSE 190 - Intro to Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Our project attempts to explore multi-agent interaction for two robotic arms, where the task is to lift an object of varying sizes that is too heavy for one to lift alone.

We use the MuJoCo environment to train the arm.

We implement the algorithm presented by Aljalbout et al: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v211/aljalbout23a/aljalbout23a.pdf, extending it by using <insert methodology here> to allow the use of a camera instead of the perfect environment representation by the simulator.
